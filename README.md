## Comparative-Study-on-General-Trajectory-Forecasting-Framework

Moreover, a comparative study on the general trajectory forecasting framework is conducted, to explore the eï¬€ectiveness of varied length of observation sequences, widely used interaction modeling methods, and the multi-modal characteristics of predicted trajectories.

1. Explore the influence of varied length observation sequences on the prediction performances.

2. Explore the effectiveness of widely used interaction modeling methods (grid-based method, social pooling layer, social attention, etc).

3. A simplify framework is proposed for multimodal trajectory generation.
