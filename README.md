## Comparative-Study-on-General-Trajectory-Forecasting-Framework

Moreover, a comparative study on the general trajectory forecasting framework is conducted, to explore the eï¬€ectiveness of varied length of observation sequences, widely used interaction modeling methods, and the multi-modal characteristics of current models.

1. Explore the relationship between varied length of observation sequences and the prediction performances.

2. A simplify framework is proposed for multimodal trajectory generation with promising results.

3. Explore the effectiveness of widely used interaction modeling methods (grid-based method, social pooling layer, social attention, etc).
